Today we are going to talk about the USRA Light Mikado AKA the USRA's most produced Locomotive design. These Mikes where made by Baldwin Lima, and ALCo (American Locomotive Company) They where built from 1918-1929. The first USRA Light Mike is B&O #4500 (which is preserved at the B&O railroad museum). My personal favorite locomotive is NKP #587 (which is in pieces awaiting a restoration after a legal dispute in Noblesville IN) Most have been scrapped due to dieselisation but 6 of the Origginal 614 are still here + 2 copies.
